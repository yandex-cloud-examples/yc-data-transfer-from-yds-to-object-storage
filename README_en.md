# Delivering data from a Yandex Data Streams queue to Yandex Object Storage through Yandex Data Transfer

With [Data Transfer](https://yandex.cloud/docs/data-transfer), you can transfer data from a [Data Streams](https://yandex.cloud/docs/data-streams) stream to an [Object Storage](https://yandex.cloud/docs/storage) bucket. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/docs/data-transfer/tutorials/yds-to-objstorage) to learn how to set up the solution with Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [data-transfer-yds-obj.tf](data-transfer-yds-obj.tf).
